# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across different cities, models, and manufacturers in the U.S. The goal is to extract meaningful insights on EV growth, performance, and regional distribution using a structured dataset.

---
## 📊 Project Overview

The dashboard is built using a dataset containing:
- EV type (BEV, PHEV)
- Model year
- Manufacturer and model
- Electric range
- Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility
- City and electric utility

Using this data, I created dynamic visuals to explore:
- Growth in EV registrations over time
- Top vehicle models and makes
- EV distribution by city
- CAFV eligibility
- BEV vs PHEV adoption rates
